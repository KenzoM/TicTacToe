The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game).

It meets the following criteria:

>User Story: I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.

>User Story: My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.

>User Story: I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

### Prerequisites

This app  utilizes the following:
- `jQuery` for DOM manipulation
- `Gulp.js`  is for task/build runner, including compiling sass files.

In addition, the opponent AI is built based [min-max algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). In other words, _you cannot ever win the game (only tie or lose to the opponent)_.

If you are able to win, send me a message and you win a prize!
